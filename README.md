# Maximizing Business Insights with Power BI Dashboards: A Case Study of MG Group [[Video Presentation]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dipu1591_dataanlytics-powerbi-salesinsights-activity-7044568108769968128-cF5j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data from a wide range of sources. A Power BI project is essentially a dashboard or report that is created using the Power BI service, and it allows users to present data in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

A Power BI project can be used by anyone who needs to analyze and make sense of data, regardless of their level of technical expertise. This includes business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, executives, and anyone else who needs to make data-driven decisions.

Power BI offers a wide range of data visualization tools, including charts, graphs, maps, and tables, as well as features such as data modeling, data cleansing, and data transformation. This allows users to not only analyze data, but also to manipulate and clean it to make it more useful and meaningful.

Overall, a Power BI project is a powerful tool for anyone who needs to work with data, and it can be used in a wide range of industries and applications, including finance, healthcare, retail, and more.

Here, I have created three different dashboards for three persons working at different positions of a company called MG. MG Group has a very large business in India, which they have divided into three zones with 4-6 cities under each. Each city has a market representative who takes care of day-to-day business accounts. Additionally, there is a zonal manager who controls the markets under him, and above them is the Head Sales Director, who directly controls each zone. MG deals with two types of customers and sells their own products, as well as distributes the goods of other companies. With such a large business and multiple levels of management, there is no alternative to a dashboard to get an overall idea of what is going on. Moreover, anyone can easily share the dashboard with their superior, embed it in PowerPoint slides of office meetings, and take data-driven decisions.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in connecting PowerBI with a RDBMS, using AIMS GRID, operating PowerBI, and using DAX. Additionally, I gained some business understanding, which is essential for any data analyst or data scientist. In the near future, I plan to focus on getting better at DAX to deep dive further into the field of data science.
